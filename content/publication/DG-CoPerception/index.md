abstract:  Collaborative perception has recently gained significant attention in autonomous driving, improving perception by enabling the exchange of additional information among vehicles. However, deploying collaborative perception systems can lead to domain shifts due to diverse environmental conditions and data heterogeneity among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).To address these challenges, we propose a unified domain generalization framework applicable in both training and inference stages of collaborative perception. In the training phase, we introduce an Amplitude Augmentation (AmpAug) method to augment low-frequency image variations, broadening the model's ability to learn across various domains. We also employ a meta-consistency training scheme to simulate domain shifts, optimizing the model with a carefully designed consistency loss to encourage domain-invariant representations. In the inference phase, we introduce an intra-system domain alignment mechanism to reduce or potentially eliminate the domain discrepancy among CAVs prior to inference. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art works. Code will be released at <a href='https://github.com/DG-CAVs/DG-CoPerception.git'>github</a>.
