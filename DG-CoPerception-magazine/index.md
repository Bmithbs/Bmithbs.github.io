abstract:  Recently, autonomous driving has attracted significant attention both on academia and industry, which is expected to bring a safer and more efficient driving system. However, the current autonomous driving system is based on single vehicle, which has some limitations that may threaten the safety of the system. For example, occlusion is an inevitable problem that single-agent perception system can not address. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to tackle these limitations. In this paper, we first investigate the challenges of collaborative perception, including communication delay, data volume, pose error, etc. Then, we discuss the countermeasures to address these challenges based on various technologies, where the research opportunities are also discussed. Then we proposed a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and transmission delay problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize the average transmission delay, thereby improving the performance of perception and increasing the efficiency of communication. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.
